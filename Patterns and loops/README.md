<h1 align="center">✨ Patterns and Loops in C ✨</h1>

<p align="center">
  <b>Mastering loops, logic, and pattern printing in C!</b><br>
  A collection of programs to strengthen your fundamental programming skills through visual patterns.
</p>

## 📘 Overview

This folder contains various **C programs** that focus on:
- Understanding and mastering **loops** (`for`, `while`, `do-while`)
- Building **pattern-based problems**
- Strengthening **logical and analytical thinking**

Each program demonstrates how nested loops, conditional statements, and simple arithmetic can be combined to create different **shapes, sequences, and structured outputs**.

---

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

✅ `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops  
✅ Nested loops  
✅ Conditional statements (`if`, `else`)  
✅ Increment & decrement logic  
✅ Alignment handling (spaces, columns, rows)  
✅ Star, number, and alphabet-based patterns

## 💻 How to Run the Programs

1. Open the desired `.c` file in your IDE or terminal.
2. Compile using:
   ```bash
   gcc filename.c -o output
   ```
3. Run the executable:
   ```bash
   ./output
   ```

---

## 🌟 Example Output

Here’s a sample for a basic star pattern:

```c
*
**
***
****
*****
```

Or a number pattern:

```c
1
12
123
1234
12345
```
