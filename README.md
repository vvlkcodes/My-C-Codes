# 💻 My C Codes Repository

Welcome to **My C Codes**, a collection of C programs that I’ve written and practiced since my **1st year of engineering**.
This repository serves as my personal journey through learning and mastering the **C programming language**, covering topics from the **first-year first semester** to the **second-year first semester**.

## 📘 About This Repository

This repo contains C programs and examples that explore fundamental programming concepts, data structures, and algorithmic logic — all implemented in **pure C**.

Each file focuses on a specific topic or problem statement that helps strengthen understanding of:

* Basic syntax and input/output operations
* Conditional statements and loops
* Functions and recursion
* Arrays, strings, and pointers
* Structures and unions
* File handling
* Dynamic memory allocation
* Data Structures in C (like linked lists, stacks, queues, etc.)

---

## 🧩 Purpose

The main goal of this repository is to:

* Serve as a **reference** for anyone learning C programming.
* Showcase my **coding progress** from beginner-level to intermediate-level C concepts.
* Maintain a **record of all my college C programming practice**.
